Assignment 3 - Binary Search Trees and Serialization

In the program we had use the BSTreeADT to create a working version of BSTReferencedBase, and BSTNode.
The working BST structure is then used in our WordTracker application to read text files and collect and store
all the unique words it finds in those files. The BSTReferencedBase will store information from multiple text files,
and it will keep track of each occurrence of a word in a file and the line it was found in that file. The program
will output to the command line a report using the iterator built into the BST.

The program is complete in it's functionality = 100%.

How to run:
Navigate to the runnable jar file located within the folder in the project via command line. 
Enter in the name of the text file you wish to read.
ie)java -jar Tracker.jar C:\\CPRG311\\sample2.txt -po -fC:\\CPRG311\\Report.txt
